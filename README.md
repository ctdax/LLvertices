This repository contains code used during splitSUSY compressed research. The functions used to generate the vertex images can be found in [VertexImageCreatorFunctions.py](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/VertexImageCreatorFunctions.py) and the template file used to run those functions can be found in [VertexImageCreator.py](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/VertexImageCreator.py). The functions used to run the CNN and output CNN results can be found in [LLCNN_VertexImages_Utils.py](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/LLCNN_VertexImages_Utils.py) and the template file used to run those functions can be found as a Google Colab Juypter Notebook under the name [LLCNN_VertexImages.ipynb](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/LLCNN_VertexImages.ipynb). Similarly the FFNN functions and colab file can be found in [LLFFNN_Utils.py](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/LLFFNN_Utils.py) and [LLFFNN_VertexImages.ipynb](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/LLFFNN_VertexImages.ipynb). Lastly miscellaneous functions used throughout the entire process can be found in [LLcommonFunctions.py](https://github.com/ctdax/LLvertices/blob/main/LLcommonFunctions.py).
